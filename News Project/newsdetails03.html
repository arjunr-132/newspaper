	<h1>‘Pattarai Karuvadu’, a unique process of making dry fish in Rameswaram, awaits Geographical Indication tag</h1>
	<p> <h4>As a child, Anthony Dheena, a polio victim, had watched his grandmother make ‘karuvattu kuzhambu’ (dry fish gravy). The fish would melt in his mouth and the taste would linger. The fish in the ‘kuzhambu’ acquired a special taste, he said, because of the method that his grandmother followed for preserving the fish.Years later, when Dheena started large-scale production of ‘karuvadu’, he followed his grandmother’s method. Today, the shop, named ‘Pattarai Karuvadum Pazhaya Kanjiyum’, at Thangachimadam in Ramanathapuram testifies to the undying spirit of this differently abled youth.<br><br> The Tamil Nadu Food Processing and Agri Export Promotion Corporation (TNAPEx) has applied for the Geographical Indication (GI) tag for Ramanathapuram ‘Pattarai Karuvadu’. The application was filed by Intellectual Property Rights attorney P. Sanjai Gandhi.</h4> </p>
